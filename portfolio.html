                        <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                        <p>Comunidad Viva is a grassroots nonprofit connecting Latino families in Portland with health, education, and legal resources. Despite serving over 200 families a year, they had no website, no online presence, and relied entirely on word-of-mouth and paper flyers. Volunteers were managing event signups through text messages, and donors had no way to give online.</p>

                        <h4>The Journey</h4>
                        <div class="portfolio-phase">
                            <span class="portfolio-tag tag-build">Build</span>
                            <p>We launched a bilingual Squarespace website with program descriptions, an events calendar, a volunteer signup form, and a donation page linked to their PayPal. We set up their custom domain (comunidadviva.org), professional email through Google Workspace, and SSL certificate. The team received a 2-hour training session on updating content themselves.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="portfolio-phase">
                            <span class="portfolio-tag tag-grow">Grow</span>
                            <p>Next, we built their digital foundation: Google Business Profile so they appear in local searches, basic SEO so families searching "recursos para latinos Portland" can find them, Google Analytics to track which programs get the most interest, and a Mailchimp newsletter to keep donors and volunteers engaged. We also set up their Instagram and Facebook pages with consistent branding.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="portfolio-phase">

                            <p>As the organization grew, we migrated them to a custom WordPress site with advanced features: an interactive program finder, impact reporting pages with infographics, integrated donation processing through GiveWP, and a full WCAG accessibility audit to ensure the site serves all community members. We completed their GuideStar and Charity Navigator profiles to build credibility with institutional funders.</p>

                        <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                        <p>Elena Torres is a mixed-media artist and muralist whose work explores identity, migration, and belonging. She was selling original pieces through Instagram DMs and local art fairs, but had no website, no way to sell prints online, and no email list. Collectors who discovered her murals around Portland had no way to find her other work or purchase it.</p>

                        <h4>The Journey</h4>
                        <div class="portfolio-phase">
                            <span class="portfolio-tag tag-build">Build</span>
                            <p>We created a clean Squarespace portfolio site showcasing her work across collections: murals, mixed media, and commissions. The site included a bio page telling her story, a gallery with high-resolution images, a contact form for commission inquiries, and links to her social profiles. We registered elenatorresart.com and set up professional email.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="portfolio-phase">
                            <span class="portfolio-tag tag-grow">Grow</span>
                            <p>We built out her digital foundation: optimized her Instagram bio and content strategy with a consistent posting schedule, set up a ConvertKit newsletter for collectors and fans (with an automated welcome sequence), configured Google Analytics to track which collections get the most interest, and implemented basic SEO so people searching "Portland muralist" or "Latina artist Portland" find her work.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="portfolio-phase">

                            <p>When Elena was ready to sell prints, we migrated her to a custom WordPress site with WooCommerce and Printful integration. Now visitors can browse her gallery and order museum-quality prints, canvas wraps, and postcards — all fulfilled and shipped automatically through Printful. We also added a WCAG accessibility audit, an exhibition calendar, and a press page featuring her mural projects and media coverage.</p>

                        <p class="portfolio-type">Environmental Youth Nonprofit &bull; Eugene, OR</p>

                        <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                        <p>Verde Youth Alliance runs after-school environmental education programs for middle schoolers across Lane County. They already had a basic WordPress site built by a board member three years ago, plus a Facebook page with 1,400 followers. But the site was outdated, slow, not mobile-friendly, and impossible for staff to update without calling the original developer. Their biggest pain point: parents, teachers, and school administrators constantly emailed and called with the same questions — enrollment deadlines, program locations, permission forms, pickup times. The two-person staff was spending 10+ hours a week just answering repetitive inquiries instead of running programs.</p>

                        <h4>The Journey</h4>
                        <div class="portfolio-phase">
                            <span class="portfolio-tag tag-grow">Grow</span>
                            <p>Rather than starting from scratch, we audited their existing WordPress site and rebuilt it on the same platform with a modern theme, mobile-responsive design, and a clear information architecture. We organized program pages by school district so parents could quickly find their location. We set up Google Business Profile, configured Google Analytics to track which programs get the most traffic, launched a Mailchimp newsletter for parent communication (replacing their scattered email threads), and optimized their site for local SEO so families searching "after school programs Eugene OR" would find them. We also trained their program coordinator to update the site herself — no more waiting on a developer for simple changes.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="portfolio-phase">
                            <span class="portfolio-tag tag-build">AI Chatbot</span>
                            <p>This is where things got exciting. We built a custom AI chatbot trained on Verde's program handbook, enrollment policies, school locations, schedules, and FAQ document. The chatbot lives on their website and answers parent questions instantly — in English and Spanish. "When does the spring session start?" "Where is the pickup location for Roosevelt Middle School?" "How do I download the permission form?" All handled automatically, 24/7. We also set it up to escalate complex questions (like scholarship requests or behavioral concerns) to staff via email, so nothing falls through the cracks. Staff received a training session on monitoring chatbot conversations and updating the knowledge base as programs change each semester.</p>
