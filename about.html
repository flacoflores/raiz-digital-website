                <h2>Why "Raíz"?</h2>
                <p><em>Raíz</em> means "root" in Spanish. It reflects what we do: help organizations build strong digital foundations that support growth for years to come.</p>
                <p>Just like roots anchor a tree and draw up nourishment, your digital presence should anchor your mission and help you reach the people who need you.</p>

                <h2>The Story</h2>
                <p>Raíz Digital was founded with a simple observation: nonprofits and artists do incredible work, but they're often underserved by the tech industry.</p>
                <p>Big agencies charge big prices. DIY tools leave you frustrated. And the rapid pace of AI development has left many organizations wondering how to keep up — or if they even should.</p>
                <p>We believe technology should amplify your mission, not complicate it. That means building things that work, teaching you how to use them, and being there when you need help.</p>
                <p>We're not trying to be the biggest agency. We're trying to be the most helpful partner for organizations doing good in the world.</p>
